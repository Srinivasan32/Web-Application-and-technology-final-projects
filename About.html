<h1 class="dashed">What is this website about?</h1>
<p>Here, this website is gonna be called "Summative Tech".  Many people these days have a problem in recognizing which sort of platform from Nodeflux is the best.<br>People cannot seem to discern whether or not they are properly using the ideal one or not.</br>
</p>
<strong>Summative Tech will help in making people understand which basic platform from Nodeflux needs improvement.<br>For example, Facial Recognition which Nodeflux uses to identify the types of face each person has.</br></strong>
<p>Let us hope that the app will be a huge help in not only helping Nodeflux to improve the platform,<br>but also to use the application for the better.</br></p>
<div>Although there are other applications that have feedback and evaluation, Summative Tech will instead show all the components:<br>like Usability, quality, and information for each specific platform on what they are supposed to be  and also people who visit the website will take time to understand just from seeing the info.</br></p>
</div>
<p>This app will showcase the about page, login, contact page, Brief information about Nodeflux, and 6 page questions about the platform feedback.</p>
<p>Before using the app, please consider visiting the original Nodeflux's website<br> as well as several other websites.</br>
