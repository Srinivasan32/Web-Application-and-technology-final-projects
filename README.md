In this project, we created an application for Nodeflux called Summative Tech. All of this is aimed to give feedback on 


Team Name: S and H

Team Members: Shravan Srinivasan(2440042872) and Hassan(2440105785)

App name: Summative Tech

Problem Statement + Motivation: Many people these days have a problem in recognizing which sort of platform from Nodeflux is the best.  People cannot seem to discern whether or not they are properly using the ideal one or not.


User problems you are solving: Summative Tech will help in making people understand which basic platform Nodeflux needs improvement. Summative Tech will hopefully change the way people use Nodeluxâ€™s Platform.

Basic interactions your app will support in service of goal: Let us hope that the app will be a huge help in not only helping Nodeflux to improve the platform but also to use the application for the better.


How is the app different? Although there are other applications that have feedback and evaluation, Summative Tech will instead show all the components like Usability, quality,  and information for each specific platform on what they are supposed to be  and also people who visit the website will take time to understand just from seeing the info.

 Design of the app( e.g: Technologies used and Wireframes/Storyboarding of the propose apps)
This app will showcase the about page, login, welcome page, Brief information, 6 page questions about the platform feedback.
